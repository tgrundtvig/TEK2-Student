# Week 1: Docker + Linux Basics

## Overview

This week introduces containerization with Docker and basic Linux command-line skills. Docker containers provide an ideal environment to learn Linux commands safely - if you make a mistake, simply delete the container and start fresh.

By the end of this week, you will understand why Docker exists, how to run containers, and how to navigate a Linux environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

1. **Explain** why containerization exists and what problems it solves
2. **Distinguish** between Docker images and containers
3. **Run** containers from existing images on Docker Hub
4. **Execute** basic Linux commands for navigation and file operations
5. **Interact** with running containers using `docker exec`
6. **Manage** container lifecycle (start, stop, remove)

## Time Allocation

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Pre-class | 1-2 hours | Reading + Docker installation + first exercises |
| Class | 3.5 hours | Hands-on exploration + Linux commands + guided exercises |
| Post-class | 1-2 hours | Advanced exploration + documentation |

## Prerequisites

- A computer with Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux
- Administrator/sudo access to install software
- Basic understanding of what a terminal/command line is

## Materials

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [quick-reference.md](quick-reference.md) | One-page cheat sheet (print this!) |
| [pre-class/reading.md](pre-class/reading.md) | Conceptual introduction to Docker |
| [pre-class/exercises.md](pre-class/exercises.md) | Installation and first steps |
| [class/exercises.md](class/exercises.md) | Guided hands-on exercises |
| [post-class/advanced-tasks.md](post-class/advanced-tasks.md) | Challenges to deepen understanding |
| [post-class/hints.md](post-class/hints.md) | Hints for advanced tasks |

## Key Concepts

- **Container**: A lightweight, isolated environment that runs an application
- **Image**: A read-only template used to create containers (like a recipe)
- **Docker Hub**: Public registry where images are stored and shared
- **Shell**: Command-line interface to interact with Linux

## What's Next

In Week 2, we'll build on this foundation to create our own Docker images using Dockerfiles and orchestrate multiple containers with Docker Compose.
